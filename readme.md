## IAM - Identity Access Manager
- Users, roles, groups, policy document (json), secret key and access key
- Roles - provide permissions to resources / services
     - instance roles
     - service roles
     - task roles
- multi factor authentication
    - for root account SMS MFA is NOT supported (Virtual MFA, Hardware MFA and U2F are supported)
- ARN
- policies
    - inline - embedded in user/role/group
    - managed - aws managed - can be reused - cannot be customised
    - customised - you create - only resides in your account
- IAM policy simulator - to test policies before production
- IAM Policy
    - principal - person or application - whom the policy is applicable for
    - resource - objects that policy covers
    - variables - placeholders - help in single policy behaving differently for each user
    - condition - for when the policy should be effective
- **cross account access** can be configured to give user of 1 account access to stuff of another account
- not for code commit
- --dry-run - to check if you have permissions without making any request - UnauthorisedOperation
- there are only 2 access types 
    - programatic access - for usual CLI, SDK, application access
    - management console access 

## Amazon Cognito - web identity federation
- used for larger companies
- cognito is ID broker - it provides seamless experience across all devices
- types
    - user pools - JWT - manage sign-in and sign-up
    - identity pool - STS (security token service) API 
        - create unique identities for users and authenticate them with web ID provider
        - only temporary access
    - aws credentials - mapped to IAM role
- SMPS - system manager parameter store - to store credentials
    - can store but cannot rotate
- **API call - STS assume-role-with-web-identity**
- **user authenticates with FB - FB gives ID token - then use this token to get temp creds via cognito**
- cognito provides features - 
    - signin signup to your apps - user pool
    - sync of user data across devices - **cognito Sync**

## EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
- types - FIGHT DR MC PIX
- **Price options**
    - on demand - office hours, peaks
    - reserved - steady, predictable, 3yr contract
        - capacity reserved
        - 3 types - standard, scheduled, convertible
        - by default - zonal instances - per available zone
        - you can buy regional reserved instances - they DONT reserve capacity
    - spot - high utilization, when data is not lost 
        - when interrupts - stop , terminate (default), hibernate - cannot reboot
    - dedicated hosts - secure, no multi-tenant virtualization
- provisions via images (ami = amazon machine image)
- provisioned per (by) availability zone
- max of tags allowed 50
- IAAS - infrastructure as a service
- **access public IP via http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data**
- EFS - Elastic File System - file system on EC2 - network file system
    - multi AZ - expensive but pay per use - need security group
    - shared file system across AZ 
    - only for linux
    - tiers - standard vs IA (infrequent access)
- EBS - block storage on EC2
- Instance Store - ephemeral - EC2 stopped, data is lost - physical (no network) - hence very high IOPs (millions)
- **Placement groups**
    - Spread Placement group - small num of critical instances - not share underlying hardware hence wont fail together
    - Cluster Placement group - 
- user data when provided to EC2 instances - for boot strap
    - runs only at boot time - when you first time launch the instance
    - scripts run with root privileges
- **EC2 Auto scaling** - new instances - always scales horizontally
    - when in VPC - are launched within subnet
    - can be in ANY AZ but within same region
    - works with both ALB and NLB
    - Scaling Policies
        - target tracking - on averages
        - simple/step scaling - on defined throughput
        - scheduled actions
    - when set up with Management console - no detailed monitoring
    - cooldown periods
- first time ssh - key pair - permission denied - chmod 0400
- ENI - assign private ips to EC2 - ssh not changed on failover
- pricing - 60sec min - not when stopped
- for EC2 to do something (cloud watch, code build, xray)- you need agents - download and run - then your installed code will integrate

## EBS - Elastic Block Storage
- persistant - if EC2 stopped, no data loss here
- network drive - AZ locked - can be attached to only 1 EC2
- to share you need to take snapshot and then create using it
- can inc size over time - pay for provisioned capacity
- **2 types (both boot volumes)**
    - General purpose SSD - GP2 - 3k to 16k iops - ratio 3:1 - 3000 IOPs bursts
    - Provisioned IOPS SSD - IO 1 ->16k IOPS -> high performance -> 50:1 is max allowed ratio
- magnetic disks (HHD)
    - throughput optimised HDD (STI) - max 500 IOPs - for streaming workloads - fast throughput - 40:1
    - Cold HDD (SCI file save) -> where data is NOT accessed regularly - max 250 IOPs - 12:1
    - Standard magnetic-> bootable -> where data is NOT accessed regularly
- configure encryption while creating EBS volume
    - supports both in-flight and at-rest
    - the "default" option is region-specific - if enabled you cannot avoid for a volume
    
## ELB - Elastic Load Balancer
- **types**
    - ALB - on OSI layer 7 - application aware
    - NLB - on OSI layer 4 - extreme performance - million requests / sec
    - Classic - both 4 and 7 - x-forward and sticky session - 504 error when app not responding
        - legacy ones - mainly used for Classic EC2 instances
- target groups - for routing traffic by hostname / ip / lambda
- SNI - to support multiple SSL/TLSs certificates
- **ELB per AZ; region locked**
- logs to show public IP address - use x-forward-for header
- separate public and private traffic
- makes instances highly available (obviously)
- communicates to instances using private IP
- can connect with Auto Scale groups to provide horizontal scaling
- can target instances only within a single region
- **cross zone balancing (always on for ALB)** - charged for NLB
    - enabled - divide traffic across AZ
    - disabled - divide traffic only within own AZ
- ALB access logs - details abt the requests
    - time, IP, latencies, path, response etc
- ALB request tracing - 
- ALB listeners - like rules
    - for HTTPS listener - deploy certificate, 
        - SSL termination - node will decrypt request and then forward them down
        - SSL pass through - downstream nodes will need to decrypt requests
- ALB errors
    - 503 - service unavailable - when downstream targets are available / set
    - 504 - gateway timeout - targets are there but not connected/reachable/responding - security group
    - 403 - forbidden - WAF not allowing
    - 500 - internal server error - 
- ALB can authenticate users using Cognito
- connection draining - 300sec by default - when marked unhealthy and terminating
- NLB exposes public static IP whereas ALB and CLB exposes DNS URLs
- may distribute load based on EC2 instance types as well - low type less load
    
## Route 53 - DNS
- applicable to EC2, S3, LB
- limit to 50 domain names - can ask aws to inc
- types
    - CNAME - canonical name - non-root hostname to ANY hostname - for non-root domain only
    - record (address record) - hostname to IP address (A , AAAA)
    - alias - best - ANY hostname to AWS resources - mydomain.com : xx.amazonaws.com - free - for both root and non-root domains
- routing policies
    - simple - default - can return more than 1 ips - browser can chose where to go - no health check
    - multi value - same as simple WITH health check - so route53 will return only healthy ones
    - weighted
    - latency - to lowest latency region
    - failover - via health checks
    - geolocation
- provides load balancing and health checks(3 default; 30sec interval), TTLs
- DNS changes will start reflecting after TTL expired only - as browser wont query until then

## RDS - Relational Database Service
- OLTP - online transaction processing
- auto scaling option available
- can scale both horizontally and vertically ??
- aws supports - mysql, mssql, oracle, postgres, aurora,  mariaDB
- when created- you get DNS endpoint (good for DR)
- set endpoint in EC2 and whitelist the EC2 security group in RDS security group
- backups
    - automated - default on
        - daily backup + transaction logs
        - to the second - saved in S3
        - retention 1-35days (default 7)
        - deleted when RDS deleted 
        - transaction logs every 5min
    - manual - user initiated, user deleted
- restoring / encryption - via new instance
    - at rest(KMS) or in-flight(SSL certificate)
- if DB encrypted, backup encrypted too
- but we can encrypt an unencrypted snapshot by copying as encrypted
- Multi AZ - **Synchronous** replica
    - stand by DB - for fail over / DR
    - not req for Aurora
- Read Replica - **Asynchronous** replica 
    - only reads - performance - scaling out - max 5
    - can be within AZ, cross AZ, cross region
    - eventually consistent
    - can be made into own DB - will break replication
    - can be set for failover / DR
- can be set up inside EC2 or outside (outside is adv)

## Aurora
- supports postgres and MySQL
- is like RDS - no flexible schema
- very cloud/high optimised
- storage automatically grows - auto scalling
- 15 read replicas - but in same region (unlike RDS - cross region)
- failover is instantaneous
- 6 copies across 3 AZ (2x3=6)
- self healing
- writer endpoint = master
- reader endpoints - connection load balancing
- aurora serverless - diff flavour
- global aurora 
    - cross region read replicas
    - global database 
        - 1 primary region for read/writes - 1 min DR to make another region primary
        - upto 5 secondary (read only) regions
        - upto 16 read replicas per secondary region

## Data warehousing
- OLAP - online analytics processing
- business intelligence - query huge data for stats or reports
- RedShift

## Elastic Cache
- in memory cache - RDS for caching
- read scaling, write scaling, multi az
- user session store - store session in cache
- for read-heavy AND compute-intensive
- **types**
    - mem cache - simple - high performance
        - no persistence - no backup
        - sharding
        - scale out/horizontally 
        - object caching
        - multi threading
    - Redis - leader boards 
        - sorting - like RDS 
        - multi az - auto failover
        - **read replicas**
        - **persisted**
        - stateful
        - encryption - at rest / in transit ( redis auth)
        - advanced data types, pub/sub , backups and restore
- strategies
    - lazy loading / cache aside / lazy population - add to cache when cache miss
        - data in cache may be stale - eventually consistent
        - read may be slow
    - write through - add to cache when db is updated
        - data not stale - data may be never read
        - write is slow
- cache eviction - LRU ot TTL
        
## S3 - Simple Storage Service
- object bases (instead of block based)
- 99.9% availability
- **unlimited storage**
- **0 bytes to 5 TB**
- **globally unique DNS**
- **Read (immediately) after write for new PUTs objects** - GET-PUT-GET may not work
- **Eventually consistent for modify / overwrites via PUTs and DELETEs**
- **PUTs by default support max 5GB data** - use multi-part upload for more 
- for file more than 100MB - multi part is any recommended
- bucket names are global but buckets are region resource
- no concept of directories or folders - just key names with slashes
- secure data by
    - user based - access (IAM)
    - resource based - bucket policies - resource based policy - mention what resource/users have access
        - ACL - to control which principals in another account can access a resource
        - CORS
    - Transfer Acceleration - use Cloud Front to upload data
- **Tiers**
    - Regular S3 - high redundancy
    - S3-IA - infrequent access - charged per retrieval
    - S3-one zone IA - stored in 1AZ - cost 20% less
    - Reduced redundancy - when data can be recreated - almost depricated - same as one zone IA
    - Glacier - archival use - very cheap -very infrequent - takes 3-5hr to retrieve
    - Intelligent tier - for unkown patterns (2 subtypes - frequent and infrequent)
- S3 lifecycle rules
    - transition actions
    - expiration actions
- **data is private by default - public access is forbidden by default**
- **Encryption**
    - in transit - SSL / TLS applied on https requests
    - at rest
        - server side
            - SSE-S3 - AES256 keys - S3 managed
            - SSE-KMS - KMS / AWS managed - you get master key
            - SSE-C - customer managed - you manage the keys but AWS encrypts/decrypts - have to use HTTPS as u will send the key - can do this only via CLI
        - client side - you encrypt before upload - u can use a lib "amazon s3 encryption client"
    - how? - add a parameter in PUT request and check for it in bucket policy
- **CORS - cross origin resource sharing - cross bucket data access**
    - access-control-allow-origin header in requests - match with CORS setting
    - access-control-allow-methods header in requests - match with CORS setting
    - access-control-max-age
- **for performance optimization**
    - if GET / read is more - use Cloud Front
    - if mixed - add hex hash PREfix to key names - so they are saved in diff partitions
    - for uploads - use multi parts and transfer accelerations
    - for downloads - use byte-range fetches
- if expect more than 300 PUT/LIST/DELETE req/sec or more than 800 GET req/sec - raise support request with AWS
- SGS - Simple Gateway Service - file system on S3
- **how to access bucket - s3://bucket - region**
- can fetch a private object via cloud front - Signed URL / Signed Cookies / origin access identity
- versioning - enable-disable - (null-wont loose previous objects) - delete marker
- S2 access logs; MFA delete
- hosting static website - 403 (access denied) error - as buckets are private
    - make bucket public
    - make bucket policy
- S3 object lock - write once read many - WORM - diff from "object locking" (when 2 PUTs come at the same time)
- S3 analytics - analyse storage access patterns
- Athena - Serverless data analysis service allowing you to query data in S3
- S3 Select / Glacier Select - select columns in csv
- S3 notifications - may miss if objects not versioned

## Cloud Front - CDN
- content delivery network
- **for fast reads and downloads**
- **first time read form root server, then store in EDGE LOCATIONS**
- eq sydney user trying to access ireland data
- **Can be used to upload data - S3 transfer acceleration**
- 2 kinds of distribution
    - real time messaging protocol
    - web distribution
- via Signed URL / Signed Cookies / origin access identity
- by default applies to all edge locations, but you can blacklist countries
- you can manually remove a file from the cache - but charged for it
- web application firewall VS network firewall
- **TTL** can be 0sec to 365 days - default is 24hr
- cannot be used to cache DB data (its for files, pages, videos etc)
- CloudFront Key Pairs - can ONLY be created by root account
- HTTPS - can be done end-to-end -> frontend-cloud front-backend
    - Viewer Protocol Policy
    - Origin Protocol Policy

## ECS / ECR
- elastic containers service / elastic containers registry
- buildSpec.yaml file
- ECR - to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images (uses S3 internally)
- ECS - to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster
- launch types
    - Fargate launch type - for serverless
    - EC2 launch types - for more control you can launch the tasks on EC2 too
    - EKS - for kubernetes
- task placement
    - binpack
    - random
    - spread
- single task vs separate task definitions
    - when containers are launched on single tasks - they share memory
- to change cluster - update ECS_CLUSTER parameter in /etc/ecs/ecs.config

## Serverless computing - Lambda
- event driven, API driven
- node.js, python, java, c#, go
- inc RAM - when more than 1 CPU then use multi threading
- lambda functions have to be independent
- **Lambda versioning** - use alias
    - within single alias - you can divide traffic to multiple versions
- **lambda deployment**
    - zip upload to lambda console
    - copy paste code in lambda ide
    - cloud formation - inline or zip the whole in S3 and refer
- **lambda concurrent execution limit 1000**
    - out of 1000 - 100 is kept for unreserved account concurrency - so we can set max 900
    - provisioned concurrency - to scale without fluctuations in latency
    - reserved concurrency - limits the maximum concurrency for the function
- **concurrent execution = (event or request per second) X (execution duration)**
- Lambda authorizer - to control access to API - 3rd party authorization strategies
    - 2 types : 
    - token based ( JWT or Oauth)
    - request parameter based
- execution env = temp runtime env
- execution context = things done above/before/outside the function handler
- 4KB limit on env var
- lambda layers - to decouple dependencies
- lambda destinations - eg. output or put msg in SQS
- to expose to public - 3 ways - create roles for public, ALB, API gateway
- create 1 alias - divide % traffic to diff versions
- lambda limits - unzipped <=250MB; /tmp 512MB ; env var 4KB
- configure auto-scaling to manage provisioned concurrency on a schedule
- Exceptions
    - InvalidParameterValueException - when you use CLI and any parameter is invalid - like role or something
    - CodeStorageExceededException
    - ResourceConflictException
    - ServiceException - for other internal errors in Lambda Service
- Step functions
    - input path and parameters
    - result path - to decide on next step
    - output path - to decide / filter what you want to send to next step
- state machines - task, choice, fail, succeed, pass, wait, parallel, map
    - you can have activities in them
- InvokeAsync - is deprecated - so use Invoke API with EVENT invoke type - for async call

## X ray
- **use X-ray to debug** - annotations or indexes in code/data/traces
    - analyze and debug distributed applications
    - for performance issues and errors
    - visualize the whole request trace
    - works with ec2, ecs, lambda, beanstalk - ie both serverless and servers
- X-Ray sampling 
    - control the amount of data that you record - input from client or application
    - modify sampling behavior on the fly
- X-Ray daemon - "agent" that needs to be running on ec2
    - listens for traffic on UDP port 2000, and relays it to the AWS X-Ray API every sec
- x-ray integration - for lambda
- You can use X-Ray to collect data across AWS Accounts. - nothing to enable - its by default
- target unified account - create a role in it; allow roles in other sub-accounts to assume this role
- for containers
    - deploy the agent as side-car
    - provide IAM task roles to the container
- with SDK
    - AWS_XRAY_TRACING_NAME
    - AwS_XRAY_DEBUG_MODE
- with lambda - env variables
    - AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING (default LOG_ERROR)
    - _X_AMZN_TRACE_ID
- segments - define fields to include in trace
- subsegments - for granular timing details
    - when resources dont provide their own segments, u can write subsegments
    - these are converted to "inferred segments" by x-ray
- both segments and subsegments may contain :
    - metadata - for details of objects and array fields
    - annotations - for indexes for filter expressions

## API gateway
- API vs API gateway
    - using API gateway we can configure which event triggers which serverless service
    - urls, http methods, SSL/TLS, targets
- API gateway caching = API response caching = stage cache
    - Cache-Control:max-age=0 -> to fetch fresh every time - but should "Require Authorization" as well
- browsers cache against same origin - so AWS uses CORS to change origin (to refresh cache)
- API gateway errors 
    - **429 - too many requests** - throttle - exponential backoff etc
    - **504 - gateway timeout - integration failure/timeout - lambda has been running for more than 29 seconds**
- use swagger to convert APIs
- API gateway provides a pass through to SOAP - no conversions
- AWS Secure token Service - cannot be used with API gateway for authentication
- API Gateway - every change needs deployment
    - stage variables - key-value config attributes - like env var
    - mapping template - map payload (request-to-request or response-to-response)
- API Gateway Usage Plans - who can use which deployed API
- canary deployment - deploy 2 gateways with same public URL - divide % traffic to 2 lambdas
- access control - via sigv4, lambda authorizer, cognito user pool - no STS
- has no user pools or security groups of its own
- to prevent unauthorised domain - restrict CORS
- 501 - not implemented - check x-ray
- integration types
    - lambda proxy integration - AWS_PROXY
    - lambda custom integration - AWS
    - HTTP proxy integration - HTTP_PROXY
    - HTTP custom integration - HTTP
    - mock integration - MOCK
- enable "active-tracing" to support xray and send incoming requests and traces to xray

## VPC- virtual private cloud
- region locked - subnets are per AZ (many SN in 1AZ, but not vice versa)
- like a VPN for your account
- private subnet id
- security group id and network ACL
- route table - default limit of 200 routes
    - a subnet can be part of one route at a time (but 1 table can have many subnets)
- vpc endpoint gateway - private subnet to connect to public aws resources like S3 and dynamoDB
- internet gateway - helps public subnet to connect to internet
- NAT gateway - helps private subnet to connect to internet - as it itself sits in public subnet
- VPC Flow logs; subnet flow logs, ENI flow logs
    - send to S3 or cloud watch (log group)
    - log all / allow / reject traffic
    - iam role
- VPC IP range is called CIDR range
- VPC peering - connect 1 vpc to another - via direct connect
    - in star formation
    - no transitive peering - A cannot go to C via B - A needs its own peering
    - can do across region, across accounts
- site-to-site vpn VS direct connect - on premise to vpc connection

## Dynamo DB
- noSQL - collection(table) - document(row) - key-value pairs
- good for session state storage
- **consistency model** 1 sec rule
    - eventually consistent read - consistent in 1 sec - by default
    - strongly consistent read
- **primary keys**
    - single attribute
    - composite = primary key + sort key
- primary key is unique ; sort key is a sequence eg date
- **indexes**
    - **when set, GSI capacity units takes precedence over the table's capacity**
    - local - same primary key, diff sort key - created with table only
    - global - diff primary key, diff sort key - can be created later
    - The GSI can throttle - provision more RCU and WCU to the GSI - 
    - sparse index - only written when sort key present in an item
- **Dynamo DB Streams = change log**
    - stores event data
    - **can be used for event triggers**
    - stores for 24hr only
    - **usually used with lambda**
    - 4 options - keys only, new image, old image, both
- **operations**
    - query - by partition key
    - scan - scan entire table - return all fields by default 
        - do many small scans for performance improvement
        - projection - when scan returns only few fields
- **performance improvements**
    - small parallel scans
    - small page size (more queries but faster with no time outs)
    - DAX for read-heavy
    - Global tables
    - choose eventually consistent over strongly consistent
- **query is more efficient in general**
- **BatchGetItem API for more efficient queries on large items**
- **Provisioned throughput**
    - RCU - read throughput - 4KB reads - 2 for eventually consistent (so divide by 2)
        - 5kb/4kb = 1.2 = considered as 2 not 1 (whole number) ??
    - WCU - write throughput - 1KB write
    - error when throughput exceeds - 400 - ProvisionedThroughputExceededException
    - applied per table
- **DAX - Dynamo Acceleration - highly available, in-memory cache, only write through**
- **when overloaded**
    - client retry
    - exponential backoff
    - reduced request frequency
- optimistic concurrency - for conditional writes
- scales horizontally
- backups - does not make DB slow unlike RDS
    - automated - but we dont have access to it - used for point-in-time-recovery upto 5 min earlier - incremental
        - not enabled by default
        - hence use - AWS Glue, Hive + EMR, Data pipeline
    - on demand
    - rest all (retention, cross region)is same as RDS

## KMS - Key Management Service
- solution to create and control your encryption keys
- KMS data size limit - 4KB
- **encryption keys are regional**
- **KMS is multi tenant whereas CloudHSM is dedicated hardware solutions**
- aws kms encrypt - command to encrypt
- aws kms enable-key-rotation
- re-encrypt API call - to encrypt with new CMK
- keys
    - envelop key / data key - to encrypt data
    - master key (CMK) - to encrypt the envelop key
- **canNOT export keys**
- **max data size 4kb** - what u can send to AWS to encrypt
- **Envelope encryption** you fetch key - the key travels on network - and you use it to encrypt - performance efficient
- GenerateDataKey - returns encrypted data key and plain text data key as well
- GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlainText - only returns encrypted data key

## SQS - Simple Queue Service
- message queue - distributed - pull based
- msgs can be delivered multiple times
- first service on aws platform
- scales automatically
- **<= 256KB**
- **canNOT prioritise messages - better to set 2 queues**
- **types**
    - standard - best effort - may not be ordered - unlimited T/sec
    - FIFO - ordered - no duplicates - 300T/sec
        - MessageGroupID
        - MessageDeduplicateID
        - ContentBasedDeduplication - This is not a message parameter, but a queue setting.use an SHA-256 hash to generate the message deduplication ID using the body of the message
- **retention - 1min - 14days - default 4 days**
    - change via queue message retention setting
- **visibility timeout - <=12hours - default 30 sec (ChangeMessageVisibility API)**
- **polling**
    - short polling - response every time - whether empty or not
    - long polling - response only when data or timeout (**20sec**) - efficient repeated polling
- not supported in all regions - only in 4
- 1st million requests are free - then 0.50 
- Delay Q - msg stays invisible from 0-900sec
- for msg >256KB to 2GB - use S3 or SQS Extended Clients
    - no multi part API / concept
- **use with SNS to "fan out" msgs to multiple queues**

## SWF -Simple Workflow Service
- task based queue (rather than msg based)
- task once assigned are never duplicated; tasks are tracked
- worker programs get tasks ; decider programs control the coordination

## SNS - Simple Notification Service
- push based
- msgs CAN be customised by protocol type
- mobile, email, website, sms, **SQS**, **lambda**
- Topic - group of recipients
- multi AZ
- publish subscribe
- **Synchronous**

## SES - Simple Email Service
- for marketing emails
- on receive reply - you can trigger lambda
- **Asynchronous**
- no subscription required

## Elastic BeanStalk
- PAAS - provisioning as a service
- **Deployment Policies**
    - All at once - app down - rollback
    - rolling - not down but performance hit - rollback - default
    - rolling with additional batches - no performance hit - no rollback - deploy on both old and new - in the end terminate the NEW
    - immutable - temp ASG is created with new instances - later these instances are moved to origin ASG
        - no rollback - deploy only on new and in the end terminate the OLD
        - traffic may flow to both for a short time
    - blue/green - the whole env is new = DNS is changed - traffic will flow on one at a time
        - no rollback - deploy only on new and in the end terminate the OLD
        - **feasible only when DB is outside beanstalk env**
- .config file (yaml or json) inside .ebextensions folder  - for configurations
- .yaml file - for env variables
- **jetty for jboss not supported**
- for HTTPS - update .ebextention/xxx.config , add SSL
- **not for lambda deployment** - use cloud formation
- can deploy war or zip -> not tar
- command "eb deploy"

## Cloud Formation
- **script based provisioning - yaml (preferred) or json**
- AWS Template Format Version - 2010-09-09
- resulting resources called **Stack**
- if any error - rollback everything
- **Terminology**
    - parameter - what will be asked
    - conditions - tests run on parameters provided
    - mapping - to be available to stack eg region
    - transfer - include snippets sitting outside the template , specify SAM 
    - resources - mandatory - resources you want to deploy or create
    - outputs - on console or input to another stack
- SAM - serverless app model - for serverless provisionings
    - sam-package - input yaml output sam-template.yaml
    - sam-deploy
    - store template / build on S3
- **nested stack** - template referenced in another template
    - **in the resources section**
- **delete entire stack on failure**
    - to prevent set up "--disable-rollback" flag in CLI and/or "Rollback on failure" to NO on console
- intrinsic functions
    - !FindInMap - returns value based on mapping section
    - !Ref - value of param or resource
    - !GetAtt - attribute of a resource
    - !Sub - substitutes variables in input string
- to reference VPC stack in another stack
    - create a cross-stack reference and use the Export output field to flag the value of VPC from the network stack
    - Then use Fn::ImportValue intrinsic function to import the value of VPC into the web application stack
- !FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ] syntax
- Exported Output Values in CloudFormation must have unique names within a single Region
- template on s3
- for lambda - u can define whole inline OR zip the whole in S3 and ref that (AWS::Lambda::Function)
- code : ->zipFile : -> inline code for lambda

## Kinesis 
- for streaming data
- 3 services
     - streams - in shards 
        - **retention 24h-7days** 
        - rapidly move data off producers 
        - realtime processing and analysing
     - firehose 
        - no retention - automated shards 
        - easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools
        - sink types/destinations - S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch, Splunk
     - analytics - run sql queries on data (using firehose)
- massively scalable - can fan out to various endpoints

## CI/CD Services
- code commit - git repo in aws - src control
    - **set notifications - via cloud watch or SNS**
    - repos are automatically encrypted
    - create cc repo - clone git repo - push to cc repo
    - updateDefaultBranch - only for branch name
    - getBranch - to get details of the branch
- code build - compile build test
    - set timeouts if takes too long
    - to debug - run locally using CodeBuild Agent
    - you cannot ssh into docker where code build runs
    - if docker push/pull issues -  check IAM permissions
    - buildspec.yml
- code deploy - deploy on EC2, lambda etc
    - in place - rolling update
    - blue/green - immutable
    - all at one ; half at a time; one at a time - combinations with above 2 deployment strategies
    - linear ; canary ; all at one - traffic flow
    - warm standby - DR scenario
    - pilot light - DR scenario
    - cannot provision , can only deploy
- code pipeline - release management - orchestration
    - **if sees test failure - it will stop**
    - can watch S3 bucket for new zip/jar/war
    - stops immediately if one stage fails
    - appsec.yml
- **Terminology**
    - deployment group
    - deployment config - **AppSec file - yaml(EC2) - yaml or json (lambda)**
    - revision = artifact
    - application = [ group + config + revision]
- **Hooks - defines actions to be done at specific points in the deployment lifecyle**
    - application start vs validate service
    - before allow traffic vs allow traffic vs after allow traffic
- canary vs linear deployment - both can shift traffic in parts - 2 increments u define vs equal intervals over time

## Cloud Watch 
- monitoring and logs
- **monitors performance of resources and reports metrics**
- by default logs stored forever - even after termination
- **in EC2 - by default monitors host level metrics**
    - n/w, overall disk IO, CPU, status check
    - canNOT see how much space left - no RAM stats
- **in code build** -> no of builds / success failure / duration etc
- in SQS - ApproximateNumberOfMessageVisible
- default monitoring
    - in EC2 every 5 min
    - others every 1 min
- high resolution - every sec - alarms every 10 sec
- GetMetricsStatistics API
- **encryption - even after months - "associate-kms-key"**
### Cloud watch alarm 
- 1min/2min detailed monitoring

## Cloud Trail 
- API calls monitoring - resource provisioning
- account-specific history, audit
- by default - logs are encrypted using SSE-S3
- by default it tracks only bucket-level action - to track object-level you need S3 Data events
- Organization trail - log all events for all accounts in the aws org created

## AWS CLI 
- personal machine - aws configure | otherwise use IAM roles 
    - creates config and cred files
- 1 ec2 - 1 role - many policies
- Pagination
    - max-items
    - page-size
    - starting-token
- default page size 1000
    - can give timeout
    - if result size is 2500 - it will make 3 calls internally but show the result altogether
- **use small page size** to avoid timeout
- default max items 100
    - still fetch all, show these many and return
- STS decode-authorization- message - need sts access in role
- when u use roles - it is internally evaluated to temp creds
- account profiles - to use multiple accounts via cli
- MFA with CLI - STS GetSessionToken - temp token for 1 hr
    
## AWS security services
- Shield 
    - on layer 3 and 4
    - protect against distributed denial of service attacks - by default amazon secures this for all services
- WAF
    - layer 7 aware
    -  monitors requests on clout front, ALB, API gateway
    - SQL injections
    - cross site scripting
    - block IPs based on rules (ip, country, header values, strings in requests)
- Macie
    - data loss prevention
    - uses machine learning to protect sensitive data
    
## Random points
- default region for all SDKs - north virginia - US EAST 1
- Route 53 - the AWS service which does not use key-value pairs
- AWS SSO - single sign on - is a separate service - can be connected to active directory
- x-ray - can be used with - lambda, ELB, API gateway
- to deploy SSL/TLS server certificates - use IAM or AWS Certificate Manager
- Burstable performance instances - T3, T3a, and T2 instances
    - provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst to a higher level
    - free for a new/recent account, within certain limit
- IAM supports only one type of resource-based policy - a role trust policy
    - define who you trust to use this resource (AssumeRole)
- ACL - to control which principals in another account can access a resource
- from one default region - to execute a command to stop an EC2 instance in another region 
    - use --region parameter    
    
- AWS Systems Manager - 
    - group systems like EC2, S3, RDS by application
    - view operational data for monitoring and troubleshooting
    - take action on your groups of resources
- Config - logs - resource-specific history, audit, and compliance

- SAM - open-source framework for building serverless applications
    - AWS::Serverless::Api - for api gateway
    - AWS::Serverless::Application
    - AWS::Serverless::Function - for lambda
    - AWS::Serverless::HttpApi
    - AWS::Serverless::LayerVersion
    - AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable - for dynamoDB
    - AWS::Serverless::StateMachine
- AWS Secrets Manager
    - easily rotate, manage, and retrieve 
    - database credentials, API keys, and other secrets
- Cannot use IAM creds for code commit
- AWS requires approximately 5 weeks of usage data to generate budget forecasts
- to use AWS budget, you need NOT be part of AWS organisation

- Access Advisor feature on IAM console - to identify unused roles
- AWS trusted advisor - help provision resources (following AWS best practices on cost, security, fault tolerance, service limits, and performance)
- IAM Access Analyser - identify resources that are shared with external entity
- Amazon inspector - for security and compliance of all apps deployed

- to limit permissions - AWS org service control policy (SCP), permission boundary
- Access Keys = id + secret 
    - for CLI and API
- Key pairs - private and public - digital signature for ssh-ing into EC2
- to use billing and cost mngmt - you just need access - not root user or anything else
- dedicate host vs dedicated instances
    - DI - on VPCs - hardware is dedicated to you - cheaper
    - DH - SERVER dedicated to your use - costly
- IAM Database authentication works with MySQL and PostgresSQL
- when data goes from 1 AZ to another AZ -> very costly in AWS
- private vs public vs elastic IP (only 5)
- security groups are region locked - has only allow rules
- load balancers are region locked
- S3 and IAM both are global services
- ec2 metadata can be accessed without any role

- access aws - 3 ways - console, cli, sdk
- how cli resolves creds
    - command line
    - env var
    - cli credentials file
    - config file
    - container creds
    - instance profiles / roles
- how sdk resolves creds
    - env var
    - java system prop
    - credentials file
    - ecs
    - instance profiles / roles

- A service role is the IAM role that Elastic Beanstalk assumes when calling other services on your behalf.
    - EC2 service role with readonly access to S3 bucket - assigned to EC2
- S3 has no cache - if role/permissions are removed, takes affect immediately
- WCU RCU should never be less - choose more if exact not there
- backend and cache CANNOT be updated in a transaction - at the same time - so invalidate it
- when need to use SSH key pair across region - generate public key and import in all region instances
- fargate and lambda both are serverless - hence when dealing with rest API, you they alone not sufficient, you need API Gateway

- AWS greengrass - IoT - operate offline, act locally, secure comm
- AWS AppSync - for GraphQL - manage mobile data when offline
- Websockets - bi-directional comm API
- GraphQL - graph query language

## some architectures
- LAMP stack - linux, apache server, mysql, php
- 3 tier - route53, elb(public subnet) , ec2 on private subnet , rds and elastic cache on data subnet
- wordpress - route 53, elb, ec2, efs
